{"name":"Web and Data mining and many things in between","tagline":"","body":"### Hi! I'm Adam. I've been a software engineer for a few years now. I favor doing projects in the realm of data mining. I dropped out of my college (3 years in) to focus on a little freelancing gig and go through an accelerator to learn the ropes of business. I saw how hard it was to start a business, chase your own clients, but loved the challenge.\r\n\r\nI discovered however, that I wasn't satisfied doing web consulting as much, so I took whatever time I could to do data mining. Here I am now, doing data forecasting, implementing question answering systems, and my current project:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mashape.com/agibsonccc/semantic-analytics\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm looking to use my own API as a basis for selling various products. My first idea is going to be data extraction/scraping software a cut above what's been produced out there. If you have any uses, or just want to reach out, please email me at agibson@clevercloudcomputing.com\r\nor skype me at: agibsonccc.\r\n\r\nThanks!","google":"UA-42346198-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
